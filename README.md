# Principal-Component-Analysis
Principal Component Analysis with NumPy

In this project, we are going to implement PCA from scratch without using any popular ML libraries like scikit learn. The data that we used is a popula ML datasets that lives on UCI repository.

 __Data Source:__ *https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data*


### Below are the key objectives of this project:
1.	Implement Principal Component Analysis (PCA) from scratch with NumPy and Python
2.	Conduct basic exploratory data analysis (EDA)
3.	Create simple data visualizations with Seaborn and Matplotlib


### Below is the summary of the tasks performed in this project:
- __Task 1:__ Introduction to the data set and the problem overview.
- __Task 2:__ Load the Data and Import Libraries
- __Task 3:__ Visualize the Data
- __Task 4:__ Data Standardization
- __Task 5:__ Compute the Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues
- __Task 6:__ Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
- __Task 7:__ Selecting Principal Components Using the Explained Variance
- __Task 8:__ Project Data Onto Lower-Dimensional Linear Subspace
